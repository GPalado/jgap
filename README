About This Release:

This represents the first production release of JGAP, the Java Genetic
Algorithms Package. After two years of development, testing, and public
alpha and beta releases, we finally feel that JGAP has reached an
acceptable level of stability for the current feature set. Work has
already begun on JGAP version 1.1, which include some much-requested
features including support for real values, a richer selection of
stock gene types, pluggable "fitness evaluators," and various small
enhancements. 

For a general list of changes, fixes, and enhancements that have been
included in version 1.0, please see the CHANGELOG file.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

JGAP documentation, including Javadocs and some basic introductory
documents to help get you started, can be found on the JGAP home page at
http://jgap.sourceforge.net. Javadocs can also be found in the javadocs/
directory of the JGAP distribution, and other documentation can be found
in the docs/ directory of the distribution. For a basic introduction to 
using JGAP, we highly recommend reading the tutorial that can be found 
both on the JGAP website and in the docs/ directory. Finally, a simple
example is also available in the src/examples directory.

JGAP 1.0 was compiled and tested with Java 1.4 on Linux and Mac OS X,
although the authors believe that Java 1.2 on any platform should be
sufficient for its use.

Please direct any questions, comments, problems, or inquiries to the
JGAP users mailing list at:
