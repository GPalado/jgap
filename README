Thank-you for trying JGAP 1.0 Release Candidate 1 (1.0-RC1 for short).
We are very interested in any feedback you might have, including details
of how you're using JGAP, what you like about it, and what you think
needs improvement. You can leave this feedback on the user's mailing
list at jgap-users@lists.sourceforge.net or, if you prefer to keep
these details private, you can email the JGAP project administrator
at mrblah@users.sourceforge.net. The more feedback we get, the more
we can improve JGAP to better meet the needs of our users. Thanks 
for your support!

About This Release:

This represents the first beta release of JGAP, the Java Genetic Algorithms
Package, which means it may contain bugs. It is, however, considered to
be feature complete (for version 1.0) and the API is considered frozen. 
For a general list of changes, fixes, and enhancements in this version, 
please see the CHANGELOG file.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

JGAP documentation, including Javadocs and some basic introductory
documents to help get you started, can be found on the JGAP home page at
http://jgap.sourceforge.net. Javadocs can also be found in the javadocs/
directory of the JGAP distribution, and other documentation can be found
in the docs/ directory of the distribution. For a basic introduction to 
using JGAP, we highly recommend reading the tutorial that can be found 
both on the JGAP website and in the docs/ directory. Finally, a simple
example is also available in the src/examples directory.

JGAP 1.0-RC1 was compiled and tested with Java 1.4 on Linux, Windows XP,
and Mac OS X, although the authors believe that Java 1.2 on any platform
should be sufficient for its use.

Please direct any questions, comments, problems, or inquiries to the
JGAP users mailing list at:

    jgap-users@lists.sourceforge.net

or to the JGAP developers mailing list at jgap-devl@lists.sourceforge.net.
