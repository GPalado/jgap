About JGAP 0.3x:

Important notes about backward compatibility:

     JGAP 0.3x adds a number of new features over version 0.2, including
     support for custom alleles. As a result, the API has changed in
     some places and is not backward compatible with the 0.2x APIs. That
     being said, converting to the new APIs should be pretty easy and
     will provide a great deal of convenience and flexibility.

This represents an alpha release of JGAP, the Java Genetic Algorithms
Package, which means it is not feature complete and probably contains 
bugs. The APIs are also considered a work in progress and are subject to
change. For a general list of changes, fixes, and enhancements in this
version, please see the CHANGELOG file.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

Any existing documentation, including Javadocs and some basic introductory
documents to help get you started, can be found on the JGAP home page at
http://jgap.sourceforge.net. Javadocs can also be found in the javadocs/
directory of the JGAP distribution, and other documentation can be found
in the docs/ directory of the distribution. For a basic introduction to 
using JGAP, we highly recommend reading the tutorial that can be found 
both on the JGAP website and in the docs/ directory.

JGAP 0.3x was compiled and tested with Java 1.4 on Linux and Windows,
although the authors believe that Java 1.2 should be sufficient.
