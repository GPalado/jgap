This represents a pre-alpha release of JGAP, the Java Genetic
Algorithms Package. Since it's pre-alpha, it's not feature
complete and probably contains bugs.

For more information, please visit the JGAP home page at
jgap.sourceforge.net.

Please direct any questions or inquiries to the JGAP development
mailing list at jgap-devl@lists.sourceforge.net.
