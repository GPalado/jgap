About JGAP 0.3:

Important Note about backward compatibility:

   JGAP 0.3 adds a number of new features, including support for custom
   alleles. As a result, the API has changed in some places and is not
   backward compatible with the 0.2x APIs. That being said, converting
   to the new APIs should be pretty easy and will provide a great deal
   of convenience and flexibility.

This represents an alpha release of JGAP, the Java Genetic Algorithms
Package, which means it is not feature complete, is not optimized, and
probably contains bugs. The APIs are also considered a work in progress
and are subject to change. For a general list of changes, fixes, and
enhancements in this version, please see the CHANGELOG file.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

Any existing documentation, including Javadocs and a new tutorial, can 
be found on the JGAP home page at http://jgap.sourceforge.net. Javadocs 
can also be found in the javadocs/ directory of the JGAP distribution. 
For a basic introduction to using JGAP, we highly recommend reading the
tutorial that can be found on the JGAP website.

JGAP 0.3 requires Java 1.2 or above.

Please direct any questions, comments, problems, or inquiries to the
