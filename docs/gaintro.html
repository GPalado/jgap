    <h3 class="subheader">What are Genetic Algorithms?</h3>

    <p>
      Genetic algorithms (GA's) are search algorithms that work via
      the process of natural selection. They begin with a sample set
      of potential solutions which then evolves toward a set of more optimal
      solutions. Within the sample set, solutions that are poor tend
      to die out while better solutions mate and propegate their
      advantageous traits, thus introducing a larger number of
      solutions into the set that boast greater potential (the total
      set size remains constant; for each new solution added, an old
      one is removed). A little random mutation helps guarantee
      that a set won't stagnate and simply fill up with numerous copies of
      the same solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, genetic algorithms tend to work better than
      traditional optimization algorithms because they're less
      likely to be led astray by local optima.  This is because they
      don't make use of single-point transition rules to move from one
      single instance in the solution space to another. Instead, GA's
      take advantage of an entire set of solutions spread throughout
      the solution space, all of which are experimenting upon many
      potential optima.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in order for genetic algorithms to work effectively,
      two criteria must be met:

      <ul>
        <li>
          It must be relatively easy to evaluate how "good" a
          potential solution is relative to other potential
          solutions.
        </li>

        <li>
          It must be possible to break a potential solution into
          discrete parts that can vary independently. These parts
          become the "genes" in the genetic algorithm.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheader">Basic Mechanics of Genetic Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      The basic operations of the genetic algorithm are simple
      and straight-forward:

      <dl>
        <dt>Reproduction:</dt>
        <dd>
          The act of making a copy of a potential solution. 
        </dd>

        <dt>Crossover:</dt>
        <dd>
          The act of swappings gene values between two potential
          solutions, simulating the "mating" of the two solutions.
        </dd>

        <dt>Mutation:</dt>
        <dd>
          The act of randomly altering the value of a gene in a
          potential solution.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>

    <h3 class="subheader">Fitness Functions and Natural Selection</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, it's necessary to be able to evaluate
      how "good" a potential solution is relative to other potential
      solutions. The "fitness function" is responsible for performing
      this evaluation and returning a positive integer number, or
      "fitness value", that reflects how optimal the solution is: the
      higher the number, the better the solution. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The fitness values are then used in a process of natural selection
      to choose which potential solutions will continue on to the next
      generation, and which will die out. It should be noted, however,
      that natural selection process does not merely choose the top X
      number of solutions; the solutions are chosen statistically such
      that it is more likely a solution with a higher fitness value will
      be chosen, but it is not guaranteed. This tends to correspond to
      the natural world.
    </p>

    <p>
      A common metaphor for the selection process is that of a large
      roulette wheel. Remembering that fitness values are positive 
      integers, imagine that each potential solution gets a number of 
      slots on the wheel equal to its fitness value. Then the wheel is
      spun and the solution on which it stops is selected. Statistically
      speaking, solutions with a higher fitness value will have a greater
      chance of being selected since they occupy more slots on the wheel,
      but selection is not guaranteed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The above metaphor can also be useful for illustrating an additional
      point: relative fitness is measured as a <em>percentage</em>, not an
      absolute value. As a result, a chromosome with a fitness value of 255
      has only about 0.4% chance of being selected over a chromosome with a
      fitness of 254. At higher fitness values, this problem is even
      more exaggerated. In order to keep your evolving solutions from
      stagnating at some point, it's important to implement your fitness
      function in such a way as to provide reasonable relative differences
      in solution fitness values at higher levels. A future version of
      JGAP may include an "auto-redistribution" feature to automatically 
      exaggerate differences in near-optimal solutions, but for now a 
      well-designed fitness function is required in these cases.
