Things to do for JGAP (in no particular order):

* Build JUnit test harness for classes in jgap

* Add events that may be broadcast throughout execution of the GA to
  make possible the creation of graphical interfaces or other status
  monitors.

* Add the ability to persist the state of the current population to an
  XML file for later use. The XML file should ideally contain everything
  needed to restore a GA to its exact state at the time of persistence.

* Make it possible for genes to be represented by user-defined objects,
  rather than just bits, to make it easier for applications that want
  to define more than two alleles per gene.
