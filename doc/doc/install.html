<h3 class="subheader">Introduction</h3>
<p>JGAP is a framework written in Java. It is not an application you can run
like an executable. But there is an example provided with JGAP you can run by
using the command line (or a batch file, preferrably).&nbsp;As I am running
Windows as operating system, the following description is somewhat orientated on
that. But JGAP is a&nbsp; piece of Java and therefor able to be run on other
systems as well! </p>

<h3 class="subheader">Laying ground</h3>

<p>First, download the JGAP package from the sourceforge site. You can use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11618" target="_blank"> this
link </a>to get to the list of available JGAP files. Make shure you get the full
installation (JGAP_FULL), not only the source code as the source would need to
be compiled before executing anything! If you know how to compile Java source,
then do it. This is a simple tutorial. </p>

<p>After that, extract the files to a directory of your choice, say to directory
named <font face="Courier New">jgap-current</font> somewhere on your harddrive. </p>

<p>Open this directory in a file manager of your choice, like Windows Explorer
for Windows systems or another one for *NIX systems. </p>

<p>There is no need for registry entries, and no entry will be created in the
start-menu of Windows. </p>

<p>In the directory you put JGAP in and opened in your explorer, there should be
three files ending with <font face="Courier New">.jar</font>. These files
contain the compiled JGAP distribution and that is all we need for now. </p>

<h3 class="subheader">Running the example</h3>
<p>Windows: Start the example by executing the batch file <font face="Courier New">start_example.bat</font>. </p>

<p>Other operating systems: Go to the command line and change your working
directory to <font face="Courier New">jgap-current</font>. Now type the
following: </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New">java -classpath ".;jgap-examples.jar;jgap.jar" examples.MinimizingMakeChange 89</font> </p>

<p>That's it! On your console there should appear something like (an example,
your output may vary as a Genetic Algorithm involves randomness):</p>

It contained the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 quarters.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 nickels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 pennies.<br>
For a total of 89 cents in 8 coins.</font></p>

<h3 class="subheader">Still problems?</h3>

<p>If you still have problems running the JGAP example or getting JGAP up and
running in general, don't hesitate posting your question to the JGAP forum <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=11618" target="_blank">here</a>!
Or look at the <a href="http://jgap.sourceforge.net">main page of this site </a>to
get further contact information </p>
