<h2 class="docTitle">Lines of code, classes and packages </h2>

<p class="text">JGAP has about <b> 33000 lines of code </b>(LOC). They are distributed over
currently <b> 302 Java classes</b> and <b> 26 packages</b>. The <b> examples </b> provided take another
<b>
118 classes</b>.</p>

<p class="text">Of course these numbers increase from time to time as JGAP is
permamently undergoing a process of evolution.</p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Test cases / Unit tests </h2>

<p class="text">JGAP is highly test-driven. As a result, a spring off from JGAP
is a published book about automated software testing with Java and JUnit.</p>

<p class="text">Currently, over 1300 test cases are featured by JGAP. Please
compare this with any other open source project of your choice!</p>

<p class="text">If you count the examples as further test cases, numbers gets
even better...</p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Documentation </h2>

<p class="text">JGAP features a lot of documentation. Most important for
hands-on developers may be the extensive Javadoc available in almost all JGAP
classes. As a commandment, Javadoc is almost always added to a&nbsp; class and
the more important methods, mostly also for simple methods like getters and
setters. Besides, there is a lot of documentation provided by this home page
(here we could need help as it is difficult keeping it up-to-date).</p>

<p class="text">When checking in source and other files to CVS (concurrent
versioning system), almost any time a descriptive comment is attached&nbsp; to
the action, appearing in CVS.</p>

<p class="text">Future statistics may join this page. If you miss something
please let us&nbsp; know (see main page for contact).</p>
