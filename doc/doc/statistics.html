<p class="text"><a href="http://jcsc.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">JCSC</a>
(Java Coding Standard Checker) was used to gather the following data about lines
of code, packages and classes. </p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Lines of code, classes and packages </h2>

<p class="text">JGAP has about <b>57200 lines of code </b>(LOC). They are distributed over
about <b>339 Java classes</b> and <b> 26 packages</b>. The <b> examples </b> provided take another
<b>
182 classes </b>in
<b>
32 packages</b><b> </b>with roughly <b>20000 lines of code</b>.</p>

<p class="text">Of course these numbers increase from time to time as JGAP is
permamently undergoing a process of evolution.</p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Test cases / Unit tests </h2>

<p class="text">JGAP is highly test-driven. As a result, a spring off from JGAP
is a published book about automated software testing with Java and JUnit.</p>

<p class="text">Currently, <b> over 1400 test cases </b> are featured by JGAP.
They occupy <b>122 classes</b> in <b>21 packages</b> with about <b>32600 lines
of code</b>. Please
compare this with any other open source project of your choice!</p>

<p class="text">If you count the examples as further test cases, numbers get
even better...</p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Documentation </h2>

<p class="text">JGAP features a lot of documentation. Most important for
hands-on developers may be the extensive Javadoc available in almost all JGAP
classes. As a commandment, Javadoc is almost always added to a&nbsp; class and
the more important methods, mostly also for simple methods like getters and
setters. Besides, there is a lot of documentation provided by this home page
(here we could need help as it is difficult keeping it up-to-date).</p>

<p class="text">When checking in source and other files to CVS (concurrent
versioning system), almost any time a descriptive comment is attached&nbsp; to
the action, appearing in CVS.</p>

<p class="text">Future statistics may join this page. If you miss something
please let us&nbsp; know (see main page for contact).</p>
