<h2><font color="#008000">Philosophy of JGAP</font></h2>
<p class="text">A complex subject such as one lying behind Evolutionary Algorithms allows to
create a huge software package containing everything and the world. To keep
things practical, we setup some leading records for the development of JGAP.
These are: </a>
<ul>
  <li>
<p class="text">
<a name="top">

Deliver stable and easy to maintain code by extensively providing unit tests for each class</a>.
Currently, there are nearly 1000 unit tests!</li>
  <li>
<p class="text">
<a name="top">

Optimize for performance </a> <a name="top">and probably neglect logical correspondence
to biological archetypes.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Make JGAP easy-to-use by providing examples (how-tos)</a>, <a name="top">easy-to-understand
    class names and architecture</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text"><a name="top">Allow for easy </a> <a name="top">extensibility by carefully
    building up the architecture </a></li>
  <li>
    <p class="text"><a name="top">Make use of interfaces and abstract base classes wherever
    useful (historical growth of the classes makes this a difficult target when
    it comes to older entities).</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Document the more important things, like upgrading to newer JGAP
      versions.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Make JGAP worth using by steering towards distributed computing and
      showing how to solve real-world examples. For the latter, Genetic
      Programming will be introduced, especially, which is very time-consuming
      and forces distributed computing.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><font color="#008000">Visions</font></h2>
  <p class="text">Currently, JGAP undergoes heavy enhancement. Just have a look at the
  feature requests. Astonishingly few bugs are reported, although JGAP is used
  by many people. The current visions for JGAP are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Introduce Distributed Computing.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Enhance monitoring capabilities.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Evolve a great Robocode robot with <a href="robocode/robocode.html">RobocodeJGAP</a></li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Add more graphical support (e.g. statistics, configurability).</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Make JGAP more popular by providing&nbsp; adapters to
      significant systems,
      steering towards symbiosis.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><font color="#008000">What we do to keep the quality of JGAP high</font></h2>
  <p class="text">As it is impossible avoiding logical and conceptual errors, we
  rely on several effective means to keep JGAP's&nbsp; quality still high:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="text">JGAP's&nbsp; documentation is extensive. You can find how-tos
      and tutorials on the homepage, many comments in the source code and a
      self-documentation by the unit tests provided. Please compare JGAP's code
      documentation with that of&nbsp; other projects. Tell us if you find a
      better documented project!</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Detect code changes and program errors by unit tests.
      There are far over 1000 JUnit tests packaged with JGAP. They are part of
      our code basis and with every release new tests are added. In case a bug
      is reported, we add a test to reveal it.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Before we publish a release, all unit tests are run.
      Additional reference implementations and the examples are also run to see
      that JGAP behaves as we expect it. Furthermore we use code coverage
      analysis (see homepage for a Clover report) to verify the test coverage of
      the productive classes delivered.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Feedback from users (i.e. from you) is taken very
      seriously. We try to find a solution for you. In case of a bug by fixing
      it, in case of a feature request by working on it, and in case of a
      question by answering it. Try it out!</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">Nothing is constant except change. Thus we try to react
      very fact to new requirements, try to release new versions as soon as the
      code basis is stable enough to do so. Additionally we keep JGAP's
      architecture up-to-date and don't take the paradigms and concepts of the
      current version as the final solution.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">JGAP's homepage is updated whenever necessary (please
      allow some delays sometimes, as we are talking about an Open Source
      project the whole time!).</li>
    <li>
      <p class="text">And lastly, we want you to contribute to JGAP. Either by
      asking questions, sending feedback, trying out the package. Or by becoming
      a developer who wants to add value to the project (see our homepage for
      contact)!&nbsp;</li>
