<h2><font color="#008000">Philosophy of JGAP</font></h2>
<p>A complex subject such as one lying behind Evolutionary Algorithms allows to
create a huge software package containing everything and the world. To keep
things practical, we setup some leading records for the development of JGAP.
These are: </a>
<ul>
  <li>
<a name="top">

Provide stable and easy to maintain code by providing unit tests for each class</a>.</li>
  <li>
<a name="top">

Optimize for performance </a> <a name="top">and probably neglect logical
    correspondance to biological archetypes.</li>
    <li>Make JGAP easy-to-use by providing examples (how-tos)</a>, <a name="top">easy-to-understand
    class names and architecture</a>.</li>
  <li><a name="top">Allow for easy </a> <a name="top">extensibility by carefully
    building up the architecture </a></li>
  <li><a name="top">Make use of interfaces and abstract base classes wherever
    useful (historical growth of the classes makes this a difficult target when
    it comes to older entities).</li>
    <li>Document the more important things, like upgrading to newer JGAP
      versions.</li>
    <li>Make JGAP worth using by steering towards distributed computing and
      showing how to solve real-world examples. For the latter, Genetic
      Programming will be introduced, especially, which is very time-consuming
      and forces distributed computing.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><font color="#008000">Visions</font></h2>
  <p>Currently, JGAP undergoes heavy enhancement. Just have a look at the
  feature requests. Astonishingly few bugs are reported, although JGAP is used
  by many people. The current visions for JGAP are:
  <ul>
    <li>Introduce Genetic Programming.</li>
    <li>Allow for Distributed Computing.</li>
    <li>Keep the code stable by securing it via unit tests.</li>
    <li>Add more graphical support (e.g. statistics, configurabiliy).</li>
    <li>Make JGAP more popular by providing&nbsp; adapters to popular systems,
      steering towards symbiosis.</li>
  </ul>
