<h3 class="subheader">What are Genetic Algorithms?</h3>

<p class="text">Genetic algorithms (GA's) are search algorithms that work via the process of natural
selection. They begin with a sample set of potential solutions which then evolves toward a
set of more optimal solutions. Within the sample set, solutions that are poor tend to die
out while better solutions mate and propagate their advantageous traits, thus introducing
more solutions into the set that boast greater potential (the total set size remains
constant; for each new solution added, an old one is removed). A little random mutation
helps guarantee that a set won't stagnate and simply fill up with numerous copies of the
same solution. </p>

<p class="text">In general, genetic algorithms tend to work better than traditional optimization
algorithms because they're less likely to be led astray by local optima. This is because
they don't make use of single-point transition rules to move from one single instance in
the solution space to another. Instead, GA's take advantage of an entire set of solutions
spread throughout the solution space, all of which are experimenting upon many potential
optima. </p>

<p class="text">However, in order for genetic algorithms to work effectively, a few criteria must be
met: 

<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="text">It must be relatively easy to evaluate how &quot;good&quot; a potential solution is
    relative to other potential solutions. </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">It must be possible to break a potential solution into discrete parts that can vary
    independently. These parts become the &quot;genes&quot; in the genetic algorithm. </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Finally, genetic algorithms are best suited for situations where a &quot;good&quot;
    answer will suffice, even if it's not the absolute best answer. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subheader">Basic Mechanics of Genetic Algorithms</h3>

<p class="text">The basic operations of the genetic algorithm are simple and straight-forward: 

<blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt class="text"><b>Reproduction</b>: The act of making a copy of a potential
    solution:</dt>
  <dt class="text"><b>Crossover</b>: The act of swapping gene values between two potential solutions, simulating the
    &quot;mating&quot; of the two solutions.</dt>
  <dt class="text"><b>Mutation</b>: The act of randomly altering the value of a gene in a potential solution.</dt>
</dl>

</blockquote>

<h3 class="subheader">Fitness Functions and Natural Selection</h3>

<p class="text">As mentioned earlier, it's necessary to be able to evaluate how &quot;good&quot; a
potential solution is relative to other potential solutions. The &quot;fitness
function&quot; is responsible for performing this evaluation and returning a positive
integer number, or &quot;fitness value&quot;, that reflects how optimal the solution is:
the higher the number, the better the solution. </p>

<p class="text">The fitness values are then used in a process of natural selection to choose which
potential solutions will continue on to the next generation, and which will die out. It
should be noted, however, that natural selection process does not merely choose the top <i>x</i>
number of solutions; the solutions are instead chosen statistically such that it is more
likely that a solution with a higher fitness value will be chosen, but it is not
guaranteed. This tends to correspond to the natural world. </p>

<p class="text">A common metaphor for the selection process is that of a large roulette wheel.
Remembering that fitness values are positive integers, imagine that each potential
solution gets a number of slots on the wheel equal to its fitness value. Then the wheel is
spun and the solution on which it stops is selected. Statistically speaking, solutions
with a higher fitness value will have a greater chance of being selected since they occupy
more slots on the wheel, but even solutions with just a single slot still have a chance. </p>

<p class="text">The above metaphor can also be useful for illustrating an additional point: relative
fitness is measured as a <em>percentage</em>, not an absolute value. As a result, a
solution with a fitness value of 255 has only about 0.4% chance of being selected over a
solution with a fitness of 254. At higher fitness values, this problem is even more
exaggerated. In order to keep your evolving solutions from stagnating at some point, it's
important to implement your fitness function in such a way as to provide reasonable
relative differences in solution fitness values at higher levels. A future version of JGAP
may include an &quot;auto-redistribution&quot; feature to automatically exaggerate
differences in near-optimal solutions, but for now a well-designed fitness function is
required in these cases. </p>
