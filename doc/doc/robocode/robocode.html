<p class="text">Robocode is a game. There is a playfield in which two virtual
robots fight against each other. A robot can perform certain actions, like
moving around, scanning the environment, shooting and turning the gun. Robocode
notified a robot if a significant event occurs, including: scanned the opponent,
hit a wall, hit by a bullet or hit the opponent.<p class="text">To write your
own robot, you can use service functions that the Robocode platform offers.
These service functions are plain Java methods. In the end, you write a Java
class that represents your robot. Here is a screenshot of a Robocode battle:<p class="text" align="center"><img border="0" src="robobattle.jpg" alt="Robots fighting a battle" width="209" height="174"><p class="text">It
is also possible that more than two robots compete against each other, but we
are more interested in the basic principles and skip that for simplicity.
<h2><font color="#008000">Using JGAP to produce robots</font></h2>
<p class="text">With JGAP 3.0, the so-called Genetic Programming (GP) has been
introduced. GP allows to write programs that conform to a specified syntax. Each
program can the be executed and measured by a fitness function.<p class="text">It
is also possible producing Java code with JGAP. Simply put, you just let the
used GP-commands return a String result. The String result represents a specific
and valid Java command.<p class="text">How that works is impressively
demonstrated by Javier Meseguer and Enrique D. Martí. Their implementation uses
JGAP to create an aspirant robot, test its fitness by competing against a strong
opponent, evaluate the results of the virtual battle, and then do further
evolutions. They also extended some Robocode base classes to make things work
better. A very nice feature is the graphical display from Robocode to
visualize the battles of the evolved robots against its opponent.</a>

<h2><font color="#008000">Get started with the JGAP Robocode example</font></h2>
<p class="text">Please do the following:
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Download <a href="robocodeJGAP.0.3.zip"> RobocodeJGAP
    version 0.3</a> (contribution by Javier
    Meseguer and Enrique D. Martí, strongly extended by Klaus Meffert with help from
    Robocode's all-hands-person Flemming N. Larsen).</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Extract the Robocode example into a folder of your choice.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Care that you have Java version 5 or 6 installed as JDK
    (Java Development Kit), a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is not enough. Care
    that your path variable is set appropriately.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Start the example by running of the provided batch files
    (.bat) respectively the corresponding commands necessary on Linux systems.
    Let the example run for some minutes. It may take some time until a good
    solution is found. Please notice: Don't place&nbsp; the files in a directory
    that contains spaces or special characters. This may cause problems with
    Java security.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text"> The battle is undertaken by the currently
    evolved robot.&nbsp;You can turn on&nbsp; the graphical display by
    adding&nbsp; the
    &quot;-gui&quot; option in the previous step at the end of the command in
    the batch file. It takes some time until the
    GUI appears as it is quite time-consuming and is just there for
    demonstration purposes. Otherwise you can see the evolution by examining the
    log messages.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">When looking at the provided batch files: The&nbsp; command-line parameter &quot;-enemy&quot;
    lets you specify an individual opponent for your robot to compete
    with. After the &quot;-enemy&quot; option you have to give the name of your
    class, e.g. &quot;<i>myrobots.MyRobot</i>&quot; for class <i>MyRobot</i>
    that resides in subdirectory <i>myrobots</i>. In the above call,&nbsp; <i>Aspirant3285</i>
    is used.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text">By looking in the <i> robots/jgap</i> subfolder you can see the
robot's source code generated with JGAP (file: <a href="Aspirant.java">Aspirant.java</a> - click on link for sample
code evolved).<p class="text">As for every individual robot evolved the Java
compiler has to be invoked, computation may take some time. In the future the
JGAP Grid will enable to compute such things distributedly in a LAN and/or WAN.<p class="text">Feedback
is very welcome!<h2><font color="#008000">Advanced options</font></h2>
<p class="text">It is possible using several options to control how RobocodeJGAP evolves
robots. These options are:</p>

    voidious.Dookious<br>
    sample.TrackFire<br>
    --- end before this line</p>
    <p>It is important to have the referenced robots available to RobocodeJGAP.

<h2><font color="#008000">Obtaining the source code</font></h2>
<p class="text">A lot of people asked for the source code of RobocodeJGAP.
Normally, I don't give it away due to the following reasons:</p>

<p class="text">1) JGAP had to be adapted and extended a lot to play together
with RobocodeJGAP.</p>

<p class="text">2) The original RobocodeJGAP version from Javier and Enrique was
strongly extended in order to get better results.</p>

<p class="text">3) Keeping RobocodeJGAP up-to-date is time-consuming.</p>

<p class="text">4) It is always paramount to give the best support possible.
This is only possible if the number of requests does not get too high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text">5) JGAP itself as the major component is open source. Really a
lot of effort was put into JGAP and RobocodeJGAP as well. In the last time,
there was not much code contribution from other people. It's hard keeping up
with two time-comsuming open source projects besides a regular job, so
RobocodeJGAP currently is not open source, but JGAP is.</p>

<p class="text">6) RobocodeJGAP is complex and is in a long-lasting beta-stage.
The point of ending beta is defined as the time when RobocodeJGAP is able to
evolve really competitive robots.</p>

<p class="text">For these tasks, I invested a lot of my spare time. No one
helped with that, although there were some offers which didn't get reality
(meaning additionl effort). So I decided to only give the code to people <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=paypal%40klaus%2dmeffert%2ede&amp;item_name=Donation%20to%20RobocodeJGAP&amp;page_style=PayPal&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;cn=Additional%20comments&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">donating
at least 20 Euros to JGAP</a>. If you donated and want to
receive the source code of RobocodeJGAP, <a href="mailto:jgap@doktor-meffert.de">please
send a short note after donating</a>, using the email address you want to get a
