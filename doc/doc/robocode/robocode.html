<h2><font color="#008000">Robocode</font></h2>
<p class="text">Robocode is a game. There is a playfield in which two virtual
robots fight against each other. A robot can perform certain actions, like
moving around, scanning the environment, shooting and turning the gun. Robocode
notified a robot if a significant event occurs, including: scanned the opponent,
hit a wall, hit by a bullet or hit the opponent.<p class="text">To write your
own robot, you can use service functions that the Robocode platform offers.
These service functions are plain java methods. In the end, you write a Java
class that represents your robot. Here is a screenshot of a Robocode battle:<p class="text" align="center"><img border="0" src="robobattle.jpg"><p class="text">It
is also possible that more than two robots compete against each other, but we
are more interested in the basic principles and skip that for simplicity.
<h2><font color="#008000">Using JGAP to produce robots</font></h2>
<p class="text">With JGAP 3.0, the so-called Genetic Programming (GP) has been
introduced. GP allows to write programs that conform to a specified syntax. Each
program can the be executed and measured by a fitness function.<p class="text">It
is also possible producing Java code with JGAP. Simply put, you just let the
used GP commands return a String result. The String result represents a specific
and valid Java command.<p class="text">How that works is impressively
demonstrated by Javier Meseguer and Enrique D. Martí. Their implementation uses
JGAP to create an aspirant robot, test its fitness by competing against a strong
opponent, evaluate the results of the virtual battle, and then do further
evolutions. They also extended some Robocode base classes to make things work
better. A very nice feature is the graphical display from Robocode to
visualize the battles of the evolved robots against its opponent.</a>

<h2><font color="#008000">Get started with the JGAP Robocode example</font></h2>
<p class="text">Please do the following:
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Download the Robocode sample <a href="robocodeJGAP.zip">here</a>
    (contribution by Javier
    Meseguer and Enrique D. Martí).</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Extract the Robocode example into a folder of your choice.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Start the example by typing <i>start.bat</i> or (in one line):<br>
    <i>
    java -Xmx512M -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false -cp "robocodeJGAP.jar;lib/robocode.jar;lib/jgap.jar&quot; CreateAspirant
    -gui -enemy evolved.Aspirant3285</i></li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">Wait until some rounds are done, the graphical display shows
    up for demonstration purposes. The battle is undertaken by the currently
    evolved robot.&nbsp;You can turn off the graphical display by skipping the
    &quot;-gui&quot; option in the previous step. It takes some time until the
    GUI appears as it is quite time-consuming and is just there for
    demonstration purposes.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="text">The&nbsp; command-line parameter &quot;-enemy&quot;
    lets you specify an individual opponent for your robot to compete
    with. After the &quot;-enemy&quot; option you have to give the name of your
    class, e.g. &quot;<i>myrobots.MyRobot</i>&quot; for class <i>MyRobot</i>
    that resides in subdirectory <i>myrobots</i>. In the above call,&nbsp; <i>Aspirant3285</i>
    is used.</li>
</ol>
<p class="text">By looking in the <i> robots/dunapep</i> subfolder you can see the
robot's source code generated with JGAP (file: <a href="Aspirant.java">Aspirant.java</a> - click on link for sample
code evolved).<p class="text">As for every individual robot evolved the Java
compiler has to be invoked, computation may take some time. In the future the
JGAP Grid will enable to compute such things distributedly in a LAN and/or WAN.<p class="text">The
source code for the example will be made available soon.<p class="text">Feedback
is very welcome!<p class="copyright">Copyright © 2005-2007&nbsp; <a href="http://www.klaus-meffert.com" target="_blank">Klaus Meffert</a>
