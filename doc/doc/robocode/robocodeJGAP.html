<h2><font color="#008000">Introduction</font></h2>

<p class="text">This page contains developer information about </a><a href="robocode.html">RobocodeJGAP</a>.
RobocodeJGAP provides an engine for using JGAP to evolve full-blown Robocode
programs as Java source code.<p class="text">&nbsp;You'll find basic information
for running RobocodeJGAP on the <a href="robocode.html">RobocodeJGAP page</a>.<p class="text">To
be able to compile RobocodeJGAP, please use the IDE of your choice. A build file
is currently not part of the distribution. For compiling, you must consider the
libraries (jar files) shipped with the distribution! See the libs-directory.
There is also a standard configuration of Robocode. If you do not use this
property files, Robocode will generate a default configuration when started via
RobocodeJGAP. RobocodeJGAP should work with Java 5 and later versions.<p class="text">The main class is
<font face="Courier New">org.jgap.robocode.EvolveRobot</font>. To
start it use the options described on the <a href="robocode.html">RobocodeJGAP
page</a>. There are basically two modes of evolving a robot. The first one is by
using a static enemy robot (see option -enemy). The other one is using a number
of enemies (see option -enemies). In any case all enemy robots used must be
available to Robocode. They must exist as compiled classes (see the original <a href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Robocode
distribution</a> which contains some compiled sample robots).&nbsp;<h2><font color="#008000">RobocodeJGAP
explained</font></h2>
<p class="text">The basic idea behind RobocodeJGAP is to have a certain set of
GP commands. Each of these commands reflects one valid Java command, i.e. the
if-construct. To make Java code out of GP commands, these commands are put
together in the form of a tree. The tree represents a valid program, but not yet
in Java. To make Java code out of it, each command (in the order it appears in
the tree) is asked to spill out a string representing the command.<p class="text">It
is important to know that only the dynamic parts of a Robocode class are
evolved. An example: All simple robot classes derive from the Robot class, this
never changes in our case. All advanced robot classes derive from the
AdvancedRobot class. RobocodeJGAP presents an option to decide which basic class
to use.&nbsp;<p class="text">To only have compilable Java programs, each GP
command contains three&nbsp; important properties. First there is the arity. It
represents the number of children a command has. A constant has no children, the
If-command has two children, one is a logical expression, the other is the
command to execute in case the expression is evaluated as true: IF (expression)
{ command }<p class="text">In case a command has children, the command specifies
at second which type is each child supposed to have. For the if-expression, the
expression command must be of type boolean.<p class="text">The third important
property of a command is its return type. A method has return type void, a
boolean constant has return type boolean. Notice that the if-command has return
type void! To be able to have more than one command (which could have other
commands under it) within a method, RobocodeJGAP utilizes sub programs (class <font face="Courier New">org.jgap.robocode.gp.cmd.SbSubProgram</font>).
Here, a sub program is only a logical container that holds one ore many commands
that are executed in sequence.<p class="text">You find the GP command classes in
package org.jgap.robocode.gp.cmd. The commands used with the simple base class,
Robot, are directly contained in this package. The commands for the
AdvancedRobot class are in the sub package adv. Complex commands that are sort
of sub programs, are in sub package complex.&nbsp;<p class="text">Evolution of
programs is done via mutation, crossing over and reproduction. Here JGAP comes
into play, nothing to do.<p class="text">After a program is evolved, it only
contains of GP commands. Their textual representation, which is equivalent to
Java snippets, is put into a corset which is static for Robocode. This is done <font face="Courier New">in
class org.jgap.RobotCodeManager</font>. Look at this class to see the static
parts. The dynamic parts are linked in via <font face="Courier New">a_subject.execute_object(...)</font>.
