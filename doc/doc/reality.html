<p>A Genetic Algorithm is an idealized model of processes and structures
occuring in nature. It is by no means meant to follow or copy nature completely.
To clarify this <b>partial </b>plagiarism, here are some few examples.<h2>Mitosis
and Meiosis</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis">Mitosis</a> is the process
where a cell separates. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis">Meiosis</a>
occurs for eucaryotes and transforms one diploid cell into four haploid cells.
Both processes are important for the sexual reproduction of humans.</p>
<p>Mitosis and meiosis are complex processes containing sub-processes. In
nature, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis#Errors_in_mitosis">errors
in mitosis </a>can occur as well as in meiosis. A computer-run Genetic Algorithm
does not have problems producing offsprings (asexually) with 100% correctness.</p>
<h2>Wobble-Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobble_base_pair">Wobble
hypothesis</a>, amino acids are encoded assymetrically by three codons. Some
amino acids are more common than others. Stop codons mark the end of a protein
synthesis. As stop codons are not present with Genetic Algorithms, effects
depending on them (such as interpreting errors) could not occur.</p>

    <h2>
          Mendelian inheritance
          </h2>

<p>In nature, the phenotypical expression of genotypical characteristics allows
for intermediary inheritance. For Genetic Algorithms, this holds only true for
special implementations of interpretations of the current genotype.
          </p>

<h2>Barr-bodies</h2>

<p>Inactive X-chromosome. For women and all female mammals owning two homologous
X-chromosomes, one is always inactivated.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As it is not meant copying nature, we are free in implementing a Genetic
Algorithm as it seems most senseful. Aspects involved in judging was could be
senseful are easy of use, capability and performance (time, memory,
convergation). One example for a difference between JGAP and other Genetic
Algorithms packages is the Genotype.evolve() method. In JGAP, we don't use a
pool of candidate chromosomes any more, although it is an established concept in
other packages. We have not noticed any losses because of this, but noticed a
speedup.</p>
