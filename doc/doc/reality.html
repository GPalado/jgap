<p class="text">A Genetic Algorithm is an idealized model of processes and structures occurring
in nature. It is by no means meant to follow or copy nature completely.
To clarify this <b>partial </b>plagiarism, here are some few examples.<h3 class="subheader">General
Architecture</h3>
<p class="text">We are referring to the interesting article <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7083/full/440416a.html" target="_blank">2020
Computing:&nbsp;Can computers help to explain biology?</a>, from which the
following picture was taken.</p>

<h3 class="subheader">Mitosis
and Meiosis</h3>
<p class="text"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis">Mitosis</a> is the process
where a cell separates. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis">Meiosis</a>
occurs for eukaryotes and transforms one diploid cell into four haploid cells.
Both processes are important for the sexual reproduction of humans.</p>
<p class="text">Mitosis and meiosis are complex processes containing sub-processes. In
nature, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis#Errors_in_mitosis">errors
in mitosis </a>can occur as well as in meiosis. A computer-run Genetic Algorithm
does not have problems producing offsprings (asexually) with 100% correctness.</p>
<h3 class="subheader">Wobble-Hypothesis</h3>

<p class="text">Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobble_base_pair">Wobble
hypothesis</a>, amino acids are encoded asymmetrically by three codons. Some
amino acids are more common than others. Stop codons mark the end of a protein
synthesis. As stop codons are not present with Genetic Algorithms, effects
depending on them (such as interpreting errors) could not occur.</p>

    <h3 class="subheader">
          Mendelian inheritance
          </h3>

<p class="text">In nature, the phenotypic expression of genotypic characteristics allows
for intermediary inheritance. For Genetic Algorithms, this holds only true for
special implementations of interpretations of the current genotype.
          </p>

<h3 class="subheader">Barr-bodies</h3>

<p class="text">Inactive X-chromosome. For women and all female mammals owning two homologous
X-chromosomes, one is always inactivated.</p>

<h3 class="subheader">Conclusion</h3>

<p class="text">As it is not intended copying nature transparently, we are free in implementing a Genetic
Algorithm as it seems most reasonable. Aspects involved in judging what could be
reasonable are ease of use, capability and performance (time, memory, convergence). One example for a difference between JGAP and other Genetic
Algorithms packages is the <i> Genotype.evolve()</i> method. In JGAP, we don't use a
pool of candidate chromosomes any more, although it is an established concept in
other packages. We have not noticed any losses because of this, but instead a
speedup.</p>
