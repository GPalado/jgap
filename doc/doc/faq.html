<p>The following is a brief collection of questions and answers that come up periodically
on the JGAP mailing lists. If you have suggestions for additional questions, please feel
free to post them to the jgap-users mailing list! 

<ol>
  <li><p class="question">Is there a way to create a fitness function that can evaluate all of
    the Chromosomes in a population at once? </p>
    <p class="answer">Yes, a bulk fitness-function can be used. The bulk fitness function is
    passed all of the Chromosomes in a population at once, and then is responsible for
    evaluating each of those Chromosomes and setting their fitness values. This can be
    especially useful when you want to evaluate Chromosomes in relationship to each other
    (rather than in isolation of each other), or if you want to make use of an external
    service to actually perform the evaluation. </p>
    <p class="answer">For more information on bulk fitness-functions, please see the javadocs
    for the </a><a href="../javadoc/2.0/org/jgap/BulkFitnessFunction.html">org.jgap.BulkFitnessFunction</a>
    class. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="question">Does JGAP support real-valued fitness values or alleles? </p>
    <p class="answer">Yes, double typed fitness values have been introduced with release 1.1.
    Before that thet type was int.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="question">Does JGAP support multiple threads? </p>
    <p class="answer">JGAP does not currently offer any support for multi-threaded or
    distributed evaluation, but this is something we're considering for a future (after
    version 2.0) release. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="question">I notice that sometimes the fittest chromosome doesn't get selected
    for the next generation. What's up with that? </p>
    <p class="answer">Natural selection in JGAP is statistical, so chromosomes that are more
    fit have a better statistical chance of being selected over chromosomes that are less fit,
    but it's not guaranteed. This is much like nature, where even the fittest of us can
    sometimes be unlucky! </p>
    <p class="answer">Incidentally, JGAP is designed to be very pluggable, and it's possible
    for you to write your own natural selector and plug it into JGAP in place of the default
    version, if that better suits your needs. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="question">Why aren't the chromosomes in my population ever candidates for
    natural selection? </p>
    <p class="answer">This can occur if you're setting up your own genetic operators and
    haven't included a reproduction operator. It's the sole job of the reproduction operator
    to guarantee that the chromosomes in the current population become candidates for the next
    generation. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="question">Has anyone used JGAP in combination with the JOONE neural networks
    package? </p>
    <p class="answer">Yes, as a matter of a fact there is a whole open-source project
    dedicated to integration of JGAP with JOONE! You can find out more about the JOONEJGAP
    project on their <a href="http://joonegap.sourceforge.net/">home page</a>. </p>
    <p class="answer">Additionally (among others), there is a dissertation about Genetic
    Algorithms playing together with Neural Nets to play Backgammon!</p>
