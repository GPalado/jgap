<p>The travelling salesman problem is the following: given a finite number of 'cities' along with the cost of travel between each pair of them, find the cheapest way of visiting all the cities and returning to your starting point. This task has deserved a serious attention from mathematicians, and a lot of literature is available. </p>

<p>The number of the possible routes increases rapidly when increasing the number of cities to visit, and the method of force become inappropriate. Genetic methods cannot find surely the best solution, but they can find the comparatively good solution in an acceptable time. <i>JGap</i> implements the solution of this task using swap mutations and greedy crossover algorithm, as it is described by (Grefenstette et al, 1985).  </p>

<p>To solve this task with <em>JGap</em>, you must define the
specific of your task by deriving class from <i><font size="2">org.jgap.impl</font>.Salesman</i>.
</p>

<p>The most critical information you need to specify is how to
measure the travel cost between the two cities. <em>JGap</em>
uses subclasses of its <em>Gene </em>to represent a city. For
example, if you use the <em>IntegerGene </em>to store the
number-city reference then you can query some local structure of
even remote database to get the travel costs or distance between
the cities. To specify the needed algorithm, you must override
the method Salesman.<strong>distance</strong>:</p>

<pre><font color="#000080"><strong>abstract double</strong></font> <b>distance</b>(Gene&nbsp;a_from, Gene&nbsp;a_to)</pre>

<p>You also need to specify the cities we need to visit, and from
which city the journey should begin. This is done by representing
a &quot;sample solution&quot;. This solution must be formally
correct, but need not be even close to the optimal one. The
sample solution must be presented in as a <em>Chromosome</em>
that can be easily constructed from the gene array.</p>

<pre><font color="#000080"><strong>abstract</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></font>Chromosome <b>createSampleChromosome</b>(Object<em>&nbsp;an_initial_data</em>)</pre>

<p>For more precise control on the solution you may also need to
override several other methods and use the parameter <em>an_initial_data.
</em>Read the <font size="2">org.jgap.impl.salesman</font>.Salesman
documentation for details.</p>

<p>After you create a working descendant of the <em>Salesman</em>
by overriding the two mentioned methods, the task solution can be
obtained just by calling </p>

<pre>Chromosome <b>findOptimalPath</b>(Object&nbsp;<em>an_initial_data</em>) </pre>

<p>The parameter <em>an_initial_data </em>is later passed to <b>createSampleChromosome.
</b>This is how you can solve multiple tasks with the same class,
creating the different sample solution from the data, stored in
your object.</p>

<p>The result is also returned in a form of <em>Chromosome</em>,
where you can easily access the individual genes.</p>

<p>You can actually do more, but other details are obvious from
the code documentation page. If you have some comments, questions
or suggestions for this implementation, please submit a bug or
rfe.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="TravellingSalesman.java">complete java
source code</a> for a simple example, where the distance between
the cities is equal to the absolute difference between they given
numbers.</p>
