<h3 class="subheader">What is a Grid?</h3>

<p class="text">A grid in our case is a distributed computing environment where
as many independent computers as possible work on a set of problems. These
computers are called workers. Each worker receives tasks from a server, the
master. The master gets fed in problems by a client. After that,
the master splits those problems into handy units where each single unit will be
processed on a single worker. After a worker has done its work for one unit, the
result can be sent back to the master. The master in turn uses the result to
advance the solution, or in the best case stop because a satisfactory solution
has been found. In the end, the client receives the solution(s). computed by the
workers.
<h3 class="subheader">Getting started with your Grid</h3>
<p class="subheader">JGAP provides an example for a grid consisting of the
components Server, Worker, and Client. Please see package <i>examples.grid</i>.
This package also hosts a file <i>readme.txt</i> that provides instructions for
setting up the grid.</p>
<p class="subheader">To use the grid, do the following in the given order:<br>
<br>
<b>
1. Start the server on a machine of your choice (called SERVER):</b></p>
<pre class="Listing">java -cp &quot;.;jgap-examples.jar;lib\log4j.jar;jgap.jar;lib\commons-cli-1.0.jar;lib\jcgrid.jar&quot; examples.grid.JGAPServer</pre>
<p class="text">
Ensure that the given jar-Files reside in the directories you specify! Each required jar-File is shipped with JGAP!<br>
<br>
<b>
2. Start as many workers as you like on machines of your choice:</b>
<pre class="Listing">java -cp &quot;.;jgap-examples.jar;lib\log4j.jar;jgap.jar;lib\commons-cli-1.0.jar;lib\jcgrid.jar&quot; examples.grid.JGAPWorker -s SERVER -n myworker1</pre>
<p class="text"><br>
Ensure that the given jar-Files reside in the directories you specify! Each required jar-File is shipped with JGAP!<br>
Each worker must have a unique name --> specify it after the "-n" option<br>
Each worker must point to the SERVER's ip address --> specify it after the "-s" option<br>
<br>
<b>
3. Start a client on a machine of your choice:</b>
<pre class="Listing">java -cp &quot;.;jgap-examples.jar;lib\log4j.jar;jgap.jar;lib\commons-cli-1.0.jar;lib\jcgrid.jar&quot; examples.grid.JGAPClient -s SERVER</pre>
<p class="text">
The client must point to the SERVER's ip address --> specify it after the "-s" option<br>
<br>
After starting the client the server receives a task from the client.<br>
After that the server splits the work into tasks and asks the started workers to compute them.<br>
After a worker has computed a task, the result is sent back to the server.<br>
The server in turn returns each solution to the client.<br>
<p class="subheader">To make your GA work with a JGAP grid, please have a look
at the classes <i>JGAPServer</i>, <i>JGAPWorker</i>, and <i>JGAPClient</i>,
provided in the example package <i>examples.grid</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
