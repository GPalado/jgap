<h3 class="subheader">What is a Grid?</h3>

<p class="text">In the case of JGAP, a grid is a distributed computing environment where
as many independent computers as possible work on a set of problems. These
computers are called workers. Each worker receives tasks from a server, the
master. The master gets fed in problems by a client. After that,
the master splits those problems into handy units where each single unit will be
processed on a single worker. After a worker has done its work for one unit, the
result is&nbsp; sent back to the master. The master in turn uses the result to
advance the solution, or in the best case stop because a satisfactory solution
has been found. In the end, the client receives the solution(s). computed by the
workers.
<h3 class="subheader">Getting started with your Grid</h3>
<p class="subheader">JGAP provides an example for a grid consisting of the
components Server (=master), Worker, and Client. Please see package <i>examples.grid.fitnessDistributed</i>.
Package <i>examples.grid</i> hosts a file <i>readme.txt</i> that provides instructions for
setting up the grid. The example distributes fitness computations to workers and
does the evolution (genetic operations such as mutation and selection) on the
client. Other scenarios, such as distributing evolution, are possible as well.
JGAP's grid architecture is very flexible because a lot of strategy classes
offer a bunch of configuration possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subheader">To use the grid, do the following in the given order:<br>
<br>
<b>
1. Start the server on a machine of your choice (called SERVER):</b></p>
<pre class="Listing">java -cp &quot;.;jgap-examples.jar;lib\log4j.jar;jgap.jar;lib\commons-cli-1.0.jar;lib\jcgrid.jar&quot; org.jgap.distr.grid.JGAPServer</pre>
<p class="text">
Ensure that the given jar-files reside in the directories you specify! Each required
jar-file is shipped with JGAP!<p class="text"><font color="#FF0000"><i>Attention:
For Linux and similar operating systems, you have to use the slash instead of
the backslash (for Windows) --&gt; Also is true for the following commands!</i><br>
</font>
<br>
<b>
2. Start as many workers as you like on machines of your choice:</b>
<pre class="Listing">java -cp &quot;.;jgap-examples.jar;lib\log4j.jar;jgap.jar;lib\commons-cli-1.0.jar;lib\jcgrid.jar&quot; org.jgap.distr.grid.JGAPWorker -s SERVER -n myworker1</pre>
<p class="text"><br>
Ensure that the given jar-files reside in the directories you specify! Each required
jar-file is shipped with JGAP!<br>
Each worker must have a unique name --> specify it after the "-n" option.<br>
Each worker must point to the SERVER's ip address --> specify it after the "-s" option
instead of the above &quot;SERVER&quot;.<br>
<br>
<b>
3. Start a client on a machine of your choice:</b>
<pre class="Listing">java -cp &quot;.;jgap-examples.jar;lib\log4j.jar;jgap.jar;lib\commons-cli-1.0.jar;lib\jcgrid.jar&quot; org.jgap.distr.grid.JGAPClient examples.grid.fitnessDistributed.GridConfiguration -s SERVER</pre>
<p class="text">
The client must point to the SERVER's ip address --> specify it after the "-s" option instead of the above "SERVER".<br>
<br>
After starting the client the server receives a task from the client.<br>
After that the work is split into tasks and the started workers are asked by the server to compute them.<br>
After a worker has computed a task, the result is sent back to the server.<br>
The server in turn returns each solution to the client.<br>
The client can process the result.<br>
<p class="subheader">To make your GA work with a JGAP grid, especially have a look
at the classes <i>ExampleClient and MyGAWorker</i> provided in the example package <i>examples.grid.fitnessDistributed</i>.
Most of the necessary stuff is done by JGAP for you.</p>
