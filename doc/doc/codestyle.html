<hr>

<p>The following is a short list of guidelines to follow when contributing code or patches
to the JGAP project. Before we commit any code to the CVS respository, we need to make it
follow these guidelines (for protection of our own sanity), so it's a lot easier on us if
your code simply adheres to the guidelines when you submit it :-) Thanks! 

<ol>
  <li>Indent 4 spaces. No tabs, please. </li>
  <li>Lines of code should not exceed 79 characters in length. </li>
  <li>Braces go on the next line, no extra indentation. For example: <br>
    <pre>
          public void foo()
          {
              doSomeWork();
          }
        </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Add the lines <br>
    <pre>
        /** String containing the CVS revision. Read out via reflection!*/
        private static final String CVS_REVISION = "$Revision: 1.1 $";</pre>
    After each class declaratin line at top of the class file. For interfaces omit the "private" statement.
  </li>
  <li>Class and instance variables, other than constants, should start with &quot;m_&quot;.
    For example, <br>
    <pre>
          private int m_myField;
          </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Method arguments should begin with &quot;a_&quot;. For example, <br>
    <pre>  
          public void foo( int a_someValue );
          </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Constants should be in all capitals. For example, <br>
    <pre>
          private static final int MY_CONSTANT_VALUE = 1;      
          </pre>
  </li>
  <li>All classes, methods, and fields require javadocs, including private methods and fields.
  </li>
  <li>All in-line comments should be &quot;underlined.&quot; For example: <br>
    <pre>
          // This is an in-line comment.
          // Notice that it is underlined.
          // -----------------------------
          doSomeWork();
          </pre>
  </li>
  <li>In general, favor descriptive method and variable names over in-line comments. For
    example, instead of: <br>
    <pre>
          // Calculate area of circle
          // ------------------------
          x = 2 * PI * r * r;
          </pre>
    <p>Do: </p>
    <pre>
          // Calculate area of circle
          // ------------------------
          areaOfCircle = getAreaOfCircle( circleRadius );
          </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Favor clean, readable, maintainable code over optimized code. Let a profiler determine
    where the bottlenecks exist and then optimize as little as possible to achieve desired
    performance. When you do optimize, please leave a very detailed comment explaining that
    the code has been optimized and what it is doing. </li>
  <li>All new code files must have a copyright statement at the top that reads: <pre>
         /*
          * This file is part of JGAP.
          *
          * JGAP offers a dual license model containing the LGPL as well as the MPL.
          *
          * For licencing information please see the file license.txt included with JGAP
          * or have a look at the top of class org.jgap.Chromosome which representatively
          * includes the JGAP license policy applicable for any file delivered with JGAP.
          */
         </pre>
    <p>You should substitute your own name in the copyright statement and update the year as
    appropriate. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Currently, we are <em>not</em> using Java 1.4 assertions in the JGAP code. We may begin
    doing so in the future, but for now please leave them out. </li>
  <li>If you end up creating a new package, please also create a package.html file that
    explains the purpose of that package. Javadoc will use this file to generate a package
    description. </li>
  <li>For developers, it's ok to commit in-progress code to CVS that doesn't work, but please
    try to avoid committing code that doesn't compile or that completely breaks everything. If
    you're going to be doing a lot of work that will likely break everything, we can consider
    creating a branch for you to work on until your code is at least semi-stable. </li>
  <li>Finally, you may find JGAP code that doesn't adhere to one of the rules. That doesn't
    mean it's ok to disregard them in your code! ;-) </li>
</ol>
