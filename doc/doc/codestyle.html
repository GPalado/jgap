<h1 class="docTitle">Brief Summary of Coding Style and Practices used in JGAP </h1>
<a class="homeLink" href="../index.html">

<p align="center">[JGAP Home]</a> </p>

<hr>

<p>The following is a short list of guidelines to follow when contributing code or patches
to the JGAP project. Before we commit any code to the CVS respository, we need to make it
follow these guidelines (for protection of our own sanity), so it's a lot easier on us if
your code simply adheres to the guidelines when you submit it :-) Thanks!<h2>Formatting
of Code</h2>

<ol>
  <li>All new code files must have a copyright statement at the top that reads: <pre>         /*
          * This file is part of JGAP.
          *
          * JGAP offers a dual license model containing the LGPL as well as the MPL.
          *
          * For licencing information please see the file license.txt included with JGAP
          * or have a look at the top of class org.jgap.Chromosome which representatively
          * includes the JGAP license policy applicable for any file delivered with JGAP.
          */        </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Add the lines
    <pre>        /** String containing the CVS revision. Read out via reflection!*/
        private static final String CVS_REVISION = &quot;$Revision: 1.4 $&quot;;</pre>
    after each class declaration line at top of the class file. For interfaces omit the "private" statement.
  </li>
  <li>Do not format javadocs by adding unnecessary spaces or indentation (javadoc
    output will do this!)
  </li>
  <li>Do not start a javadoc for parameters with a capital letter. Do not end
    such text with a period.
  </li>
  <li>In methods: Order of javadoc elements should be:
    <ul>
      <li>description of method</li>
      <li>add a blank line</li>
      <li>parameters</li>
      <li>return value (if appliacable)</li>
      <li>throws (if applicable)</li>
      <li>add a blank line</li>
      <li>author</li>
      <li>since (here you should enter the next JGAP version to be released,
        i.e. &quot;2.4&quot; (without quotation marks)).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All in-line comments should be &quot;underlined.&quot; For example:
    <pre>          // This is an in-line comment.
          // Notice that it is underlined.
          // -----------------------------
          doSomeWork();</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Indent 4 spaces. No tabs, please. </li>
  <li>Lines of code should not exceed 79 characters in length. Please take this
    very seriously! </li>
  <li>Braces go on the next line, no extra indentation. For example:
    <pre>          public void foo()
          {
              doSomeWork();
          }</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Class names always start with a capital letter and contain no underscores.
    THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!
  </li>
  <li>Class and instance variables, other than constants, should start with &quot;m_&quot;.
    For example,
    <pre>          private int m_myField;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Method arguments should begin with &quot;a_&quot;. For example,
    <pre>          public void foo( int a_someValue );</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Constants should be in all capitals. For example,
    <pre>          private static final int MY_CONSTANT_VALUE = 1;         </pre>
  </li>
  <li>All classes, methods, and fields require javadocs, including private methods and
    fields.
  </li>
</ol>

    <h2>
          Programming
          </h2>

<ol>
  <li>Favor clean, readable, maintainable code over optimized code. Let a profiler determine
    where the bottlenecks exist and then optimize as little as possible to achieve desired
    performance. When you do optimize, please leave a very detailed comment explaining that
    the code has been optimized and what it is doing. </li>
  <li>Currently, we are <em>not</em> using Java 1.4 assertions in the JGAP code. We may begin
    doing so in the future, but for now please leave them out. </li>
  <li>If you end up creating a new package, please also create a <font face="Courier New"> package.html</font> file that
    explains the purpose of that package. Javadoc will use this file to generate a package
    description. </li>
  <li>In general, favor descriptive method and variable names over in-line
    comments. For example, instead of:
    <pre>          // Calculate area of circle
          // ------------------------
          x = 2 * PI * r * r;        </pre>
    <p>Do: </p>
    <pre>          areaOfCircle = getAreaOfCircle( circleRadius );</pre>
  </li>
  <li>When adding a new class or new method, you could add the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11618&amp;atid=361618" target="_blank"> RFE</a> number in the
    javadoc comment. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Test cases</h2>
<ol>
  <li>For each new class introduced there should be one new (JUnit) test class
    created extending <font face="Courier New">junit.framework.TestCase</font>
    (see the JGAP unit tests for examples)</li>
  <li>Each test case class is added to a test suite class containing a reference
    to all unit tests in the package the test suite class is lying. See <font face="Courier New">org.jgap.impl.AllImplTests</font>
    for example.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Test clase and test suite classes are lying in a different directory
    branch than the source code classes. Please see the JGAP CVS: <font face="Courier New">src</font>
    is the toplevel directory for source code and <font face="Courier New">test</font>
    is the toplevel directory for test code. Please notice, that the <font face="Courier New">src</font>
    and <font face="Courier New">test</font> directory both have the same
    package hierarchy!</li>
  <li>
    <pre>For test cases, the class heading javadoc should write (e.g. for class StringGene):

<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;/*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * Tests the StringGene class
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  * ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  * @author ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  */</font></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Don't add any outputs to the console (<font face="Courier New">System.out</font>
    or <font face="Courier New">System.err</font>) in your test cases. In nearly
    any case this could be avoided completely by using explanatory messages with
    exceptions or the JUnit <font face="Courier New">fail(...)</font> method.</li>
  <li>It might be useful looking at the existing unit tests to get some hints
    about how to do exception handling etc. Also see <a href="http://javarunner.blogspot.com/2005/01/test-driven-development-useful.html" target="_blank">Test-Driven
    Development: Useful Techniques, Resources</a>.</li>
  <li>The blog entry <a href="http://javarunner.blogspot.com/2005/06/intentionally-failing-junit-tests.html" target="_blank">Intentionally
    failing JUnit tests</a> could be a useful resource.</li>
  <li>If you don't feel sure when to write your tests (before, during or after
    coding), the blo entry <a href="http://javarunner.blogspot.com/2005/02/when-tdd-is-not-optimal.html" target="_blank">When
    TDD is not optimal</a> might be useful.</li>
</ol>
<h2>CVS</h2>

<ol>
  <li>For developers, it's ok to commit in-progress code to CVS that doesn't work, but please
    try to avoid committing code that doesn't compile or that completely breaks everything. If
    you're going to be doing a lot of work that will likely break everything, we can consider
    creating a branch for you to work on until your code is at least semi-stable. </li>
  <li>It is better to check in quite often than to wait too long with committing
    your work. </li>
  <li>When checking in something to the CVS, you should do this per class as you
    could then add a useful comment. It is not forbidden adding the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11618&amp;atid=361618" target="_blank"> RFE</a> number
    (the request number from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11618&amp;atid=361618" target="_blank"> JGAP sourceforge RFE
    page</a>) in the comment! </li>
  <li>If using WinDiff: It's much more comfortable using an external viewer
    (such as WinMerge) than using the internal textual representation. </li>
</ol>

<h2>In general</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Finally, you may find JGAP code that doesn't adhere to one of the rules. That doesn't
    mean it's ok to disregard them in your code! ;-) </li>
  <li>If you think an important functionality is missing or there is a design
    flaw in JGAP, feel free to post this as a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=11618&amp;atid=361618" target="_blank">RFE</a>. </li>
</ol>
