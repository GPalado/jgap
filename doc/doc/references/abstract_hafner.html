<p class="MsoNormal"><b> Improving Airline Schedule
Reliability Using A Strategic Multi-Objective Runway Slot Assignment Search
Heuristic</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Improving
the predictability of airline schedules in the National Airspace System (NAS)
has been a constant endeavor, particularly as system delays grow with
ever-increasing demand.&nbsp; Airline schedules need to be resistant to
perturbations in the system including Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) and inclement
weather.&nbsp; The strategic search heuristic proposed in this dissertation
significantly improves airline schedule reliability by assigning airport
departure and arrival slots to each flight in the schedule across a network of
airports.&nbsp; This is performed using a multi-objective optimization approach
that is primarily based on historical flight and taxi times but also includes
certain airline, airport, and FAA priorities.&nbsp; The intent of this algorithm
is to produce a more reliable, robust schedule that operates in today’s
environment as well as tomorrow’s 4-Dimensional Trajectory Controlled system
as described the FAA’s Next Generation ATM system (NextGen).<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This
novel airline schedule optimization approach is implemented using a
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm which is capable of incorporating limited
airport capacities.&nbsp; The core of the fitness function is an extensive
database of historic operating times for flight and ground operations collected
over a two year period based on ASDI and BTS data. &nbsp;Empirical distributions
based on this data reflect the probability that flights encounter various flight
and taxi times.&nbsp; The fitness function also adds the ability to define
priorities for certain flights based on aircraft size, flight time, and airline
usage.&nbsp; <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The
algorithm is applied to airline schedules for two primary <st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:country-region 
w:st="on">
US</st1:country-region>
</st1:place>
 airports: Chicago O’Hare and <st1:City w:st="on">
Atlanta</st1:City>
 Hartsfield-Jackson.&nbsp; The effects of this multi-objective schedule
optimization are evaluated in a variety of scenarios including periods of high,
medium, and low demand.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The
schedules generated by the optimization algorithm were evaluated using a simple
queuing simulation model implemented in AnyLogic.&nbsp; The scenarios were
simulated in AnyLogic using two basic setups: (1) using modes of flight and taxi
times that reflect highly predictable 4-Dimensional Trajectory Control
operations and (2) using full distributions of flight and taxi times reflecting
current day operations.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;The
simulation analysis showed significant improvements in reliability as measured
by the mean square difference (MSD) of filed versus simulated flight arrival and
departure times.&nbsp; Arrivals showed the most consistent improvements of up to
80% in on-time performance (OTP). Departures showed reduced overall
improvements, particularly when the optimization was performed without the
consideration of airport capacity.&nbsp; The 4-Dimensional Trajectory Control
environment more than doubled the on-time performance of departures over the
current day, more chaotic scenarios.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This
research shows that airline schedule reliability can be significantly improved
over a network of airports using historical flight and taxi time data.&nbsp; It
also provides for a mechanism to prioritize flights based on various airline,
airport, and ATC goals.&nbsp; The algorithm is shown to work in today’s
environment as well as tomorrow’s NextGen 4-Dimensional Trajectory Control
setup.<o:p>
