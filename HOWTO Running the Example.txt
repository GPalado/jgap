The example included with JGAP consists of two classes.
They are both located in package "examples".

Main class is MinimizingMakeChange.class

Just start this class with a parameter between 1 and 99
which indicates a sum to be reached by summing together
a given number of coins with different values.

Example for starting the example:

java -classpath ".;jgap-examples.jar;jgap.jar" examples.MinimizingMakeChange 89

or use (for Windows) the batch file start_example.bat

Also see the JGAP homepage at
http://jgap.sourceforge.net
for details about the example.

Especially read the Getting Started section on the page!
