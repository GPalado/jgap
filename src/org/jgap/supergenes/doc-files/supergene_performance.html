<h2 class="docTitle">The test</h2>

<p>The test task: given amount [20..99] in pennies. Express this
value in pennies, nickels (5 pennies), dimes (10 pennies) and
quarters (25 pennies), additional requiring, that the number of
pennies and nickels should be both even or both odd. For some
amounts the ideal solution does not exists, and the system should
suggest an alternative with a slightly different change amount. </p>

<p>In the supergene version, the chromosome, representing the
solution of the task, consisted of 2 regular genes (quarters and
dimes) and one supergene, enclosing two subgenes (nickels and
pennies). The supergene validity condition was set to nickels <em>mod</em>
2 = pennies <em>mod</em> 2. The alternative algorithm used
chromosome with 4 independent genes and estimation function,
including the mentioned condition.</p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Conditions</h2>

<p>The test program computed the change for all values from 20 to
99, measuring the computation speed and deviation from the ideal
solution (exact change amount and the satisfied additional
condition). The test was repeated 10 times, averaging the data.
The test program was executed on computer, having Intel Pentium 4
2.5 Mhz processor, 512 Mb RAM, Windows XP SP 2.0, Java 1.4.2
b-28.</p>

<h2 class="docTitle">Results</h2>

<p>The results were dependent from the population size and
maximal allowed number of iterations.</p>

<p>For the small population size (64) and small number of
iterations the supergene method is a little more accurate,
running roughly at the same speed as the simplified version.
However this advantage decreases when incrasing the number of
allowed iterations.</p>

<p>For the moderate population size (512) the supergene method is
significantly (up to three times) faster than the simplified
version. </p>

<p>For a large populations (1024) the supergene method may be
slightly less accurate. However this difference seems minor,
 and the method is still up to three times faster than the
simplified version.</p>

<h3 class="docTitle">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The supergene conception can significantly (up to 3 times)
increase the evolution speed. It can also increase the accuracy
of solution for the small populations. However these effects are
dependent from the chosen population size and maximal number of
iterations. While in some cases the use of supergenes can be
definitely sensible, we would recommend to try both supergene and
non-supergene versions for your specific task. </p>
